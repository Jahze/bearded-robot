- some stuff says dpps is slow:
    - tried this for dot3:

        mov xmm0,[v1]
        mulps xmm0,[v2]
        andps xmm0,[mask] ; (0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0x00)
        vhaddps xmm0,xmm0
        vhaddps xmm0,xmm0

    - performed a tiny bit faster in standalone test
    - in practice no faster (tiny bit slower maybe)
    - CONCLUSION: find a better way to expand it or stick with dpps

- performance looks a lot better when clamps are removed from final color output
    - but then goes to shit in weird circumstances, e.g.:
        -> remove 'k' local and use value directly
        -> swap float clamped for '= dp;' or '= max(dp, 0.0);'
